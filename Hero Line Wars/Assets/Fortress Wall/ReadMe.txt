Build your own Fortifications around your City with the Fortress Wall Pack.
The models can be used on Mobil or any other platform, it contains a Low Poly version and a more Detailed Model if supported.
It also has Hand painted High Quality textures.
You can build the Wall on a Grid based system, or any angle you want, as sown on the Screenshots.
It uses only one Texture, a 2048x2048 TGA

The Pack is grouped in a main folder named "Fortress Wall Pack" and it has a Demo Scene, shown on the Screenshots, and the Prefabs folder, which contains all the elements.
Thank you, and may it serve you well!
